Other than that, it starts up pretty fast .
 Its faster to load, easier to use, and it has a new feature called the library where you can access all your related files in one window .
 Performance wise it is slightly faster than Vista and I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds difference for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .
 If you have newer hardware, 64, bit is probably the way to go as it is faster and will allow you to take advantage of more than 3 .

 Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use .

1 Very fast SDHC scanning speed in comparison to vista and xp  big headache relief .
 It might do that on vista   but I got the trojans recently and haven't been using vista as much since it's on a slow HP mini netbook that gets sickeningly hot to the touch .
5 Seems to load the desktop much faster than vista, but it might be because I have 2 gigs of ram on my w7 netbook and only 1 on my vista one .
This is much faster than visata and I love it .
Some of the things I like most about Windows 7 is how fast it boots up and shuts off .
